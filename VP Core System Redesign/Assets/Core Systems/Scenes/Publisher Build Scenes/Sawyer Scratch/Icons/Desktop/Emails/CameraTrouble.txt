SUBJ: Camera
TO: jrasher@cove.com
~Hey Jacob,

Do you know anyone who works with cameras by any chance? Some of my photos are corrupted (I suspect a disc issue) and there’s some important stuff I’d like to salvage if possible. Hope you’re doing well, see you at the office tomorrow.

Thanks,
Brent
