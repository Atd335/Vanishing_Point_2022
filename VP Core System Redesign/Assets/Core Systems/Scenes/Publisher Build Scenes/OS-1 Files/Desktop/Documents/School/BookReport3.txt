The Haunted Mask book report by Eloise Watters

I did not like the book. Steve and Chuck scare Carly with a scary costume and she does not like it. They put worms in her sandwich and scare her with a spider. They make her look silly infront of everyone at school in a mean way. Then she goes to a place with costumes and masks and thinks she can scare them back. She buys a mask and when she wares it she gets mean and hurts people, and she cant even take it off. She can only do it because her mom loves her, but then Noah wears it and probably also cant take it off. There is no lesson.
