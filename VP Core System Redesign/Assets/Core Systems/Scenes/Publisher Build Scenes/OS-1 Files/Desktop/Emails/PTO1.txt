~Hi Zoe,

I’d like to put in a formal request for some time off this week if possible. My daughter has a book report coming up and she needs a hand with it. She just started middle school and it has been a difficult transition. It’s important to me that I’m able to be there for her. Any chance I could get Monday and Tuesday?

Thanks,
Brent
