~Hey Brent,

Sounds like an exciting time for Eloise! Tell her to keep her chin up and not to drive herself crazy with school, I’m sure she’ll be making lifelong friends in no time. If she keeps her nose to the grindstone maybe she’ll be working here one day ;^)

I hate to say it, but I don’t think we can spare you. It’s all hands on deck until we hit the beta milestone for the Echo project. If you really think you need it, we might be able to accommodate a day in the next couple of weeks, but it would really slow things down — I don’t know how the rest of the team would feel about that. As the lead on this project you need to remember what you signed up for; they need you. You’re a valued member of our family, and this family needs everyone to be pulling their weight. If you’re worried about Eloise, it might be time to hire a babysitter (I can refer you to mine if that would be helpful,) maybe she could even stop by the office one of these days!

You’ve been doing great work. Let’s keep that momentum going.

ZC
